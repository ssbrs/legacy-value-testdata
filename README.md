# Legacy Value Test Data

This repository contains test data for ssb legacy data. TODO: Link to the spec

There are two directories: `nay` contains data that is *not* a valid json transport encoding of a legacy value. `yay` contains four files for each piece of data:

- `foo` is a valid json transport encoding of a legacy value
- `foo.json_signing` is the signing encoding for this value
- `foo.length` is the length of the signing encoding (number of utf16 code units)
- `foo.sha256` is the sha256 hash fo the signing encoding (hashing only the less significant byte of the utf16 code units)

---

This data has been generated by running [this](https://github.com/sunrise-choir/legacy-msg-js) over the corpus of a fuzzer doing some roundtrip checks for the [rust implementation](https://github.com/ssbrs/legacy-msg).
